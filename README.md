VideoBrain transforms any YouTube video into an interactive and intelligent learning experience. By simply providing a link, the tool:
-->Enables real-time question answering based entirely on the video’s content
-->Summarizes the core content
The Q&A feature is at the core of VideoBrain. It allows users to engage with video material conversationally—ask specific questions, revisit complex sections, or clarify topics instantly, without rewatching or skimming through the entire video.

At its core, VideoBrain is built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles. It uses LangChain, embeddings, and vector stores to break down transcripts, index them semantically, and retrieve relevant chunks to generate context-aware answers with LLMs.
